  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

    # Customize the amount of threads for the VM:
    vb.cpus = 2
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more

  # Sets up devkitPro and pokeruby/pokeemerald
